 can you really even call it a movie,1,technically there was no cohesive storyline dialogues were all over the place conversations between characters were weird like every time one would say something and other would go into an unrelated monologue mostly ranbirits nothing like the trailer story is not about son and father they didnt show anything about their relationship after the first few scenescoming to content ranvijay never knew to answer a question straight his character had no consistency even if you make a negative character his actions need to be consistent in one instant they want to show he is unhinged and doesnt care and then next instant he would forgive and protect thema movie needs to have a story a plot characters need to make sense inside the movietheir attempt at jokes were so distasteful he gives a wedgie to a servant rants about his underwear theres two monologues about pubic hair theres denial about medicineeven the climax was so underwhelming they just faught in one songworse part was how they used sikhs in the movie they tried to use them to do idk what but theyre just around to elevate ranvijay and in main climax theyre told to stay back then killed on screen helplessly why would you show something like thatall in all as a movie it sucks due to lack of story and badly written characters then theres the content
 a film for the clinically insane made by a psycho,1,the movie glorifies violence physical and sexual abuse denigration of women and basically banks on shock value to provoke viewers rather than pull in people with a coherent storythe director will claim that he is some sort of indian tarantino but its not even close just a badly made movie with a man whom every woman must be careful of and stay very very very far away consider this a warning and avoid this psycho and his movies nothing good can come out of themits specially troubling when you know that these movies will appeal to already mysoginistic men in india and encourage further crimes against women really feel bad for women who now will have to put up with more misogyny because of trash like this
 such a shame for even animals to name this movie,1,ranbir personal show with no story no logic and absurd action scenes anil kapoor and boby are wasted totally the film story is from the age where there are no law and enforcement exists you can do whatever you want to either its your own country or you are in foreign kill as many people as want  to make a century of corpses is like a piece of cake zero emotions and no chemistry between father and sonnot even close to a worst family drama and yes its not a family movie strong language lot of unwanted smooching and obscenity spend 35 hrs with your father or if you are father spend quality time with your son and save yourself from this disaster
 embarrassingly awful,1,went to see it with my 2 boys last night in manchesterwhat looked like an awesome film from the trailer turned out to be an awful experience an embarrassment of 2023be sharmi be hayaaii be ghairati the indians are fast losing their sense of identity as they try so hard to westernise themselves but none of the western world watches any of this kind of trash so why bother losing your authenticitythis film is a sex romp with a mindless and senseless killing spree it beggared belief and on so many occasions we just wanted to walk out but hung in there hoping against hope it would improveranvir kapoor an excellent actor was unable to make the film look intelligent at all and a deaf bobby deol now looking aged was thrown in for good measure in the last 20 minutes anil kapoor looked lost with the odd decent dialogue but nothing out of the ordinaryit was just killing upon killing with scenes and dialogues of sex that would make bollywood no go films with your daughter or mother any wonder that bollywood is dying out slowly and actors are out of work carry on with this trajectory and hindi cinema wont exist in another 20 years as it will have lost itself completelydistasteful disrespectful disgusting
 a toxic symphony of violence and misogyny,1,animal the latest cinematic blunder from director sandeep reddy vanga is a film that assaults the senses and insults the intellect the story if one can call it that centers on vijay a gangster as devoid of depth as he is of conscience ranbir kapoors portrayal of this abhorrent character is as unsettling as it is uninspired his performance lacking any nuance or complexity reduces vijay to a mere caricature of toxic masculinity animal is a cinematic disaster a toxic symphony of violence and misogyny it offers no insights no entertainment and no redemption it is a film that should be avoided at all costs lest it leave its viewers feeling as empty jaded and disturbed as vanga himself
 probably the worst movie ive ever seen,1,you seriously need to question the sanity of the director producers and even the actors of this film im a bit traumatized by the movie and ive seen my fair share of gore this movie was beyond bad and the storyline defies logic which makes it even worse too many instances where basic questions and clarity in communication wouldve reduced the screen time from three hours to two hours max the worst part is the director is planning on a sequel soonif you value your hard earned money and your mental health i would advise you to abstain from watching this 3 and a half hour torture of a film
 pathetically cringe no closure except for boneheads lusting for blood,1,i have a migraine watching this cringe movie literally every aspect of this movie is cringe and in terms of originality this is rajneeti meets kabir singh with an overdose of papa papa give it a rest you can love your father without being abusive to the rest of the world and the great thing is that there is still no closure for the audiences whove been wound up for 35 hours in the hope of at least a detentethe visionary directory sandeep reddy vanga goes to town bringing every debunked cliche to life  the cliched alpha shtick the slaphappy father who favors the soninlaw over his own son the subjugated wives and mother the 1 alpha killing 100 of people not an exaggeration armed with a couple of axes creating body doubles as if thats a thingthe funniest part is that the climax fight with bobby deol literally has its own narration ongoing in the form of a song in the background  as if singing ye dekho kaisa thappad maara with every slap landedno closure is offered to any of the sub plots ongoing with the protagonists  the relation with the wife the kids or even the father to compensate for this sandeep reddy vanga overcompensates with gratuitous violence to satisfy the enraged crowd watching this trash never having been involved in as much as a scuffle much less an actual fightthe plot is as simple as it gets and its clear sandeep reddy vanga didnt have a story to tell as much as a couple of ideas for scenes he wanted to execute based on his diminutive understanding of marathi music fetishization of sikh youth and culture and more importantly his bloodlust to satisfysuch is the bloodlust that even the postcredits scene is drenched in more blood than most animes and thats saying a lot
 it was embarrassing to watch the movie after a point,1,the movie is ridiculously bad keep the misogyny aside which is absolutely horrid the movie is still looks like a headless chicken running around there is absolutely no story i wanted to leave the theatre on so many occasions yep it was that ridiculousthere is such a lack of logic as well ranbir kapoor is in supreme health just a short while after getting a heart transplant and beats the hell out of bobby deol ranbir is killing 200 men alone while his sikh brothers are singing in the background heights of stupidityplease do not watch the movie and give it attention that it clearly does not deserve
 worst ever movie,1,when we make a female lead movie everyone labels it as a feminist movie but even then those movies just portray how a woman challenges society and comes forward in life society cant accept even that and rates the movie so low then what about this nonsense movie is this not a misogynist movie how many movies like this are shown to insult women and objectify them why is no one labelling such movies as misogynist when it actually is why are we still showing women as objects in such kind of movies what is it with movies like kabir singh and animal this movie is so disgusting it shows how ranbir is in real life look at the movies alia chooses and look at the movies this useless fellow chooses he either chooses a playboy movie or a movie where he objectifies women poor alia to be married to such a misogynist
 this animal is exceptionally brilliant but needs a team of psychologists to cure him,7,this is surely one of the best movies that bollywood has produced in the last 10 years in terms of entertainment all things from storyline to music and from action scenes to quality of acting are brilliantly planned and executed even though the running time of the movie is almost 35 hours you actually dont feel its lengthrk has really nailed it this time this performance can be surely counted as one of his very best in terms of quality of acting as much as i want to say the same thing for rashmika the element of common sense is simply not allowing me firstly the quality of acting displayed by her is disappointing compared to her previous performances and further i am still not able to understand why someone like her accepted the movie after reading the scriptmay be due to rk the character she plays feels like a clown in the moviethe adult scenes in the movie were forcefully forced into the script and felt very unnatural the first half of the movie is the most striking and impressive aspect but sadly it starts to lose momentum every minute in the second half unnecessary and untimely placement of songs further declines the experience the movie deviates from its original plot  theme several times which can be frustrating another frustrating part is that several dialogues in english and punjabi language are said so fast that 90 of audience fails to digest them lack of twists and turns makes it boring at times boby deols screen time is not more than 25 minutes and that too without a single dialouge which is again disappointing and surprising because the trailer of the movie makes him look like one of the leadsbut all things said we cannot deny the fact that it is something very fresh and unique which the audience will love one of the most aesthetically appealing  enjoyable movie from bollywood in long time the message it delivers between a father and son is very beautiful and climax makes up for all the faults it haspurely a theatre movie will not be that satisfying if witnessed on mobile or laptop
 disappointing,4,animal directed by sandeep reddy vanga offers a captivating experience with impressive background music memorable songs and technical finesse however the film stumbles in terms of story strength and screenplay execution featuring temporal shifts that lack coherence and fail to enhance the narrativewhile the first half engages with its fast pace the second half unnecessarily prolongs the story leaving the film feeling overly lengthy and lacking character development especially with ranbir kapoors character his abrupt temporal shifts lack clear reasoning contributing to a disjointed narrativedespite a touching emotional scene between anil kapoor and ranbir kapoor towards the end it arrives too late leaving the audience fatigued and eager for closure the credit scenes though appealing add to the films unnecessary lengthranbir kapoors character portrayed as a hero raises concerns due to his criminal actions lack of respect for others blatant misogyny and attitude problems the films attempt to celebrate such a character is problematic as it glorifies a manchild who in reality needs therapyactress rashmika mandannas performance is very poor making her unfit for the role she was struggling to deliver convincing dialogue and lacked depth in her portrayalits disheartening to witness bollywood failing with films like animal the industry has the potential for impactful cinema but seems to fall for subpar narratives they should strive for better storytelling and more nuanced character portrayals and should avoid the pitfalls of glorifying problematic characters for the sake of entertainment
 absolute wild animal,8,man ranbeer kapoor and his pind brothers what a lit and elite squad absolutely run havon in the cityvanga simply says it bluntly on everyones face i will dare to do what i want and show what i want and he has done thatvangas vision is completely fulfilled by ranbeer and all other actors movie becomes little boring in 2nd half but the finale is good it is about the real man to man fightam still in awe of ranbeers role this is his best acting till date kudos to all rashmika did grt in her part as well as anil kapoor bobby has also done good this is a must watch theater exprnc
 this garbage glorifies school shooting enough said,1,complete garbage glorifies school shooting objectifying women toxic realtionships unstable personalities degrading of mental health professionalsany sensible person can not give this movie a great review really please get a mental evaluation if you like the moviehow is a young student going with gun and shooting in college a glorifies thing now when a whole country is suffering from such an endemic situation ushow is being toxic in a relationship and using sex as solution a glorified situationhow is the concept of alpha and idiots joining up for pride of family committing crime a glorifies situationbeyond all these massive gigantic colossal holes in plots and poorly developed characters honestly the kind of garbage sometimes bollywood produces is amazing knowing that they have produced amazing works in similar vein like gangs of wasseypur etc not even in same zip code these movies if they are trying to capture violence between two family and emotions for revenge
 toxic,1,i dont think i have felt so enraged after watching a movie prominent figures especially actors in a country where movies have so much impact on the population should behave with certain social responsibilities with absolutely no story and such ill treatment of people especially women there is no scope to appreciate any creative angle just naming the movie animal does not justify validating the excessive misogyny elitism and narcissism also there is a line to where it gets excessive but that was crossed way back and you still have to sit through the movie which could have ended at intermissionhating the fact that this movie is getting a good opening and could have a sequel puke
 a father son tale carved in blood,7,ranbir kapoors introduction as a superstar in the film initially raised skepticism for me however as i reached the halfway point it became evident that he truly deserved the titlesandeep reddy vangas promise to showcase genuine violence in cinema was effectively fulfilled in an era dominated by highbudget action films and contrived flashbacks vanga dared to create a world where everything is heightened to the maximum making the violence seem normal and the behavior even more unsettling one particularly striking scene involves ranbir who after discovering a mole compels the individual to lick his shoe as a bizarre demonstration of love its a level of intensity reminiscent of something quentin tarantino might appreciateaddressing the question of logic its acknowledged that the film like many others is inherently illogical drawing parallels with films like vikram kgf and bahubali its recognized that crafting a movie with absolute logical coherence is a formidable challengehowever the film does have its drawbacks the character arcs of certain individuals such as the mother sister and villain felt underdeveloped the heros revenge arc could have benefited from more nuanced writing and rashmikas character while an improvement from vangas previous works still warranted additional depthin summary while i wouldnt classify it as a masterpiece the film has its merits particularly in exploring the dynamics of fatherson and husbandwife relationships alongside the intense action sequences its a unique cinematic experience that some may appreciate for its visceral yet somewhat polarizing elements
 the craziest and the most badass indian movie,10,animal the craziest and the most badass indian movie that will ever be experienced by the audience on the screen so far since 110 years definitely falls under the cult categorythe boldest director sandeep vanga reddy takes us through the journey of a sons possessiveness towards his dad to the volcanic extreme that he is just replacing love with vengeance peace with war gentleness with rage and saneness with madnessmost of the scenes are original and never seen beforeranbir kapoor stuns you with the most complex character and your jaw will be dropped with shock and awe for his mind boggling acting along with various emotions stampede he just tears open the cinema screen with his brilliance and ease as he transforms from a raging teenager to animal man and there is no stopping even with a meteorthis marks him as the best actor of indian cinema with a launchpad to reach the eliteshaving to match him is no easy feat but rashmika mandanna does it elegantly with stubbornness and gutsanil kapoor is a class apart with his stature and maturitybobby deol is back with a bang he delivers his career best performance although his screen presence is very short a bit disappointingthe story is uniquely presented with full heart and woven really well with astounding screenplay and terrific musicstrictly for 18 years the alpha man kicks in with no good social message pure violence rampage and massacre in partswish some uncomfortable scenes were edited and also movie duration trimmed first part of second half as its 3 hours 22 mins longanimal movie cracks open the movie industry with the boldness and crookedness and roars loudwatch at your own risk
 atrocious disaster,1,this movie is such an atrocious movie the poorest of the scripts in recent years ranbir kapoor is definitely an over hyped actor unnecessary the movie has been exaggerated for so long ranbir kapoor looks weird in macho in fight seen he definitely is not meant for these kind of such scenes a time when movies of 2 hours seem to be too long without a good script this movie is a torture for three hours 20 minutes this fiction has miserably failed to create a positive impression and convey any message to the society ranbir looks psycho is his character and so in his acting too many unnecessary characters in the movie has made it a big failure
 animal without teeth,3,all bark and no bite thats the point of the movie animal in 5 words when you sit down in the theatre to experience the much hyped one of best movies of 2023 and receive randomized unnecessary scenes in the name of extravagant cinema you feel let down and cheatedsure theres a lot of action violence gore anger that people may not have seen before in a state side movie but if it doesnt relate to the story the characters of the movie and most importantly the emotions of the film it feels like you have been cheated out of 3hrs 21mins of your precious time and money so behold something you dont understand you dont like and yet you will spend money on it sad and shameful the only saving grace of the movie is bobby deol
 top class acting world class action,8,in the cinematic landscape of the past 5 to 7 years this movie stands as a beacon of originality amidst a sea of formulaic productions breaking free from the recycled narratives its a refreshing sip of new wine in an industry often pouring old ones into new bottles amidst the exceptions like bahubali and kgf this film emerges as a paragon of authenticity witnessing moments of emotional intensity it could be deemed one of the most emotionally charged films to date the films pacing is a tale of two halves with the first delivering entertainment and intensity while the second gains fervor upon bobby deols entry sandeep reddy vangas audacious storytelling steals the spotlight cementing animal as a standout in this years cinematic landscape the amount of violence in this movie is overwhelming in a good way the blood and gore is not for the faint hearted definitely a benchmarkranbir kapoors fantastic performance and transitions set this violent revenge saga on fire hands down ranbir kapoors stellar performance solidifies his position as the superstar of indian cinema ak is excellent in the confrontational scenes and bobby looks menacing but both have very little to do rashmika did a good job a mustwatch for those seeking a gripping and wellcrafted film highly recommended
 too long,1,after the long wait my friends and i went to the morning show of this movie and the theater was packed i was excited to watch it because i liked the trailer but despite the interesting first half and a great scene before intermission the entire cast started doing nonsensical things after the break it seemed like the director instructed them to do anything imaginable to bore the audience until the climax scene which was somewhat good despite the casts performances i found this movie extremely skippable rashmika was improving bobby deol deserved more screen time and ranbir kapoors performance deserved a better film overall its not worth your time while the background music makes it somewhat watchable i still recommend skipping it you might as well go to the zoo and watch a real animal youll be done in 12 hours rather than spending more than almost 3 hours and 30 minutes watching this unnecessarily violent misogynist low on story cheap adult film with mediocre action and far too many nonsense scenes
 sandeep literally challenged the status quo and won over,9,simply put its a masterpiece the director literally put his heart in this one the complex relationship of father and son explained in a such a manner i dont feel anyone ever dared to take such a step in indian cinema i literally enjoyed every minute of the movie it felt so realistic at times ranbir finally gave a great performance after sanjui mean just look at the facts sandeep made 200mins movie which means fewer shows plus he made it adult for it to be raw and as real as possible both these things require guts everyone told me to cut the movie down and make it ua but i am so glad he didntindian cinema these days have become very typical like at times being a movie lover i find it difficult to understand that why are our writers and directors not being creative or trying something new different interestingbut finally we are seeing creative movies and trust me the background score acting music costumes everything was just wow and i know there will be people who might find this movie too bold too strong lengthy and violent i dont oppose to such things i just feel we should appreciate that atleast someone tried to break the status quo and make such a bold movie
 welcome to animal park,9,just watched animal hold the breath its a bloodshed blockbusterranbirs daring  dashing performance never seen in screen before just nailed the role he is really a versatile actor he did this with so intensity bobby deol is in beast mode rashmika got a decent role this is a masterpiece by sandeepreddyvanga and ranbir kapoor which will remain in everyones heart for years and years remember the name sandeep reddy vanga all hail pride of our tfi  special mention to my brother harshavardhan rameshwar knew him since arjunreddy dayswhat a bgm man that interval fight goosebumps guaranteed with this film srv will enter to next league of filmmakers in indian cinema huge expectations will be on spirit now in this web series era where people sit hours and hours to watch their fav genre we can easily spend and watch those extra 1520
 insanely bad movie,1,what a disastrous movie this movie isnt suited for our indian culture and traditions extreme and exceeded adult content with bed and lots of lip lock scenes also filled with lust and double meaning dialogues these kind of movies affect the youth and masses a lot and leads to commit crimes i feel shame for having this kind of psycho directors in my telugu state who dont respect our culture and never think of the youth and effect of these kind of movies on the societyhe has done his film course in australia as he told in a show but he shouldnt rub his insanity on our people he might fit for foreign movies but not for indian cinema i dont know how the sensor board allowed such nasty and vulgar scenes with offensive dialogues may be they bribed them anything can possible in india with money thats our fatei felt ashamed while watching alone whenever the lead characters think of sex and starts a conversation and do so as two unknown young girls were sat next to me in theatre many couples and youngsters has come to watch the movie may be by thinking that this is an action and drama movie you cant watch this movie with your any family membernow a days some of the directors are going beyond the limits for the attention of the youth and masses to make money by leaving the ethics and values if there were no adult content and unnecessary scenes and kisses this movie would have been a blockbusterdont spoil the young future generations and also our culture traditions for the sake of money
 c grade movie,1,ranbir kapoor had to be pretty desperate to sign up for such a bgrade script this is like the old bgrade mithun movies  revenge storyline plenty of violence and women being shown their proper place merely tagging on a fatherson conflict adding some raw dialogs and getting an alister to play the protagonist does not elevate a movie from bgrade to agrade of course people with a certain mentality enjoy this kind of stuff  no doubt it will mint obscene moneysome of the reviewers here are saying it is pathbreaking etc  pathbreaking for what for making bgrade mainstream about ranbirs acting nothing great over acting and over shouting ahem as befits a bgrade movie also beats me why a talented actress like tripti would agree to be a part of such a regressive movie
 not a movie a shouting competition,4,as a fan of gore and dark noir went with loads of expectations first half was off to a near flawless flight but then the tailspin which began postinterval took down the whole movieexcellent bgm magnificient cinematography and out of the world acting by ranbir what a brilliant actor he is fell short to save the movie ridden with lack of depth and emotion in the storyline the loosely written plotlines and characters severely dilapitated ranbirs character as well because the other characters were so underdeveloped lack of motive in even the central character resulted in a lack of conviction in the whole story to such a level that after taking in so much of grandly choreographed violence one is left scratching head wondering everything happened for what exactly emotion got translated i nto only one sided shouting and the viewer is left alone to experience an exhausting and frantic tv debate show where only the tv anchor gets to shoutsevere formula plotpoints and scenes  some of which are inspired from godfatheroldboy2003 the man from nowhere 2010 rajneeti and even kabir singh were put together in such a way that one is left doubting whether the director wanted to copy from his own previous success just because it worked earlier but it didnt result in anything like kabir singh because everything was so incoherent the brilliant opening of the movie by the directors own obcession of using pointless violence or might be a desperate attempt to cover up the flaws in storyline got reduced into one and only point who can shout the loudest or thats what a predatory animal is supposed to do a nonhuman who shouldnt be part of humane society but gets occassionally breaded by our society it emanates an excruciatingly agonizing world around it unable to love empathize dialogue  sense of integrity but is just filled with suffocating anger  treachery
